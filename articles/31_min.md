**31 minutos** is a Chilean comedy television series and a children's music band created by the production company Aplaplac that began on 2003 by the National TV. The program is a parody to 60 minutos, a news program of the same channel, transmitted in the 70s/80s. It focuses on the adventures of the team of a news program of little prestige in which something unexpected always happens, whose presenter is Tulio Triviño. The program's notes are educational and leave an explicit or implicit message, while others are quite ridiculous. Through the years they also developed a musical channel with famous chilean rock musicians and a great quality for children ~~and adult-children~~ ears.

From 2004 to 2007, it was broadcast throughout Latin America by Nickelodeon and from 2015, it began to be broadcast by Cartoon Network and Netflix LA.

31 minutos has performed throughout Chile and Mexico, making the program a musical band with their long-lived songs. On their tours they perform the songs broadcast on the program and their musical works outside of it.
