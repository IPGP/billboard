# Review of Scenery - Ryo Fukui

## Souce: Wikipedia

Scenery (シーナリィ) is a 1976 jazz album by Japanese pianist Ryo Fukui. It was Fukui's first release.

The album was virtually ignored in the United States, as it came out at a time of reduced American interest in jazz. However, it was well appreciated by Japanese fans and critics alike. In the decades since Scenery's release, the album has earned greater critical praise. Fukui's dexterity and self-taught style has earned him comparison to such piano greats as McCoy Tyner and Bill Evans.

Very good jazz album, but unfortunately not enough known. I suggest to listen to it while studying, working or as music background.
