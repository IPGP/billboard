## An album that roars and scream in your insides and lets you spew your insides to the outsides.

### Making you really confuse whether its the song that screams or really your body innards.

Theres just nothing like coming home to do some work and hearing the sound of annoying irish music eminating from my roomates stereo. This music truly makes me sick to my stomach. There is just something in McKennett's voice that seems to cause nausea, and possibly intestinal bleeding. I urge anyone who considers buying this to spend the next 2-3 months locked in a room with something by a real musicial in the stereo
